A subsequence of a permutation is defined as a collection of elements of the permutation given in order. When a permutation of length n is given with a prespecified integer value for the expected subsequences, a longest increasing subsequence and a longest decreasing subsequence can be found by this program. As we mentioned, solution may not be unique. In our case, we have the list of values whose lenght is 5 when the length of the expected subsequences is specified as 3.
